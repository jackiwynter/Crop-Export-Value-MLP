# Forecasting Crop Export Values Using Multilayer Perceptron Model

### Description:
This project focuses on designing a multilayer perceptron (MLP) model to predict the export value of crop products for a geographical region three years into the future. The model is trained and tested on a provided dataset, with the option to implement either a regression or classification approach. The task emphasizes applying machine learning principles to real-world forecasting problems, ensuring robust performance evaluation and ethical considerations.

### Key Components:

1. Model Design: Construction of an MLP model, including defining activation functions, loss functions, and strategies to prevent overfitting.
2. Features and Labels: Identification and derivation of relevant features and labels from the dataset, detailing the rationale behind feature selection.
3. Preprocessing: Implementation of preprocessing steps to optimize the dataset for model training and testing.
4. Performance Evaluation: Quantitative assessment of the model's performance, supported by mathematical formulae and metrics such as accuracy, precision, or error rates.

### Tools and Libraries:
- Python
- Scikit-learn
- TensorFlow/PyTorch
- Pandas and NumPy
  
This project showcases practical applications of machine learning techniques in agricultural forecasting, demonstrating expertise in model building, evaluation, and optimization.
